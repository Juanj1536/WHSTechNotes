My thoughts on this shift is that if they keep depending too much on ai people will just want to use ai instead of traditional roles.I think that Ai will not help workers because people will just want to use Ai instead of workers and at the end they will just use Ai.I would prepare myself before this happens by making sure i get a job with little to no ai

The application should have features like plaeer stats, real time game data, and predictions. It should also show this data in graphs and dashboards.
You can use different types data structures like lists,dictionaries,and databases to store player stats.Lists can keep track of stats,dictonaries can hold player info,data bases can store everything together.

Technology can help close the language gap between generations. For example,teachers can use apps to learn the latest slang, making it easier to connect with their students. This helps create a friendlier and more understanding classroom. Translation tools can also help everyone understand new slang terms.
But its important to use these tools carefully.Teachers should stay professional and be respectful of different cultures when using slang. By using technology wisely, teachers can better connect with their students and make learning more inclusive for everyone.
