My thoughts on this shift is that if they keep depending too much on ai people will just want to use ai instead of traditional roles.I think that Ai will not help workers because people will just want to use Ai instead of workers and at the end they will just use Ai.I would prepare myself before this happens by making sure i get a job with little to no ai
